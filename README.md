# Password Generator

## Description
This password generator asks you for Five Criteria: the desired length of your password and whether you want any combination of a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, a special character (!@#$%^&*-+), or a number.  
That's Five more Criteria than the other password generator you're not using: because you're using this one!&nbsp;      
The code behind it all is pretty and organized; it's like candy, but for your eyes. A combination of two different functions come together to generate the password ("makeFunction" and "writeFunction").  

## Challenges and Reflections
This was tough to squeeze out! Between having found out the hard day what day it was and a mad scramble to gather up research off the web (I had to change a sizable chunk of the code as I went. It did help me get familiar with a lot of the keywords did, but boy did it take a while.) and asking questions of fellow classmates (no one was physically harmed in the making of this generator, they were only psychologically tormented). It was certainly a learning experience. I'm proud though.
